## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Structure
I have created global variable to get access to the main sections in the HTML document
I defined also the main class names in the global sections to make sure they can be changed easily
Most of the comments explaining the features are embedded in the JS file itself
